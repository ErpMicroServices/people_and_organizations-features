  I want to add, update, or remove purposes on a communication event
  So that I can better manage communications

  Scenario: I can add a purpose to a communication event
    Given the following types:
      | communication event         | Incoming call    |
      | communication event purpose | Interrupt dinner |
      | communication event status  | done             |
      | contact mechanism           | test             |
      | party                       | Person           |
      | party relationship          | Testing          |
      | party relationship status   | Active           |
      | party role                  | Sender           |
      | party role                  | Receiver         |
    And there are 2 parties with a type of "Person" in the database
    And party 1 has a party role of "Sender"
    And party 2 has a party role of "Receiver"
    And a party relationship of type "Testing" between party role "Sender" and party role "Receiver" in status "Active"
    And a communication event with a note of "This is a note"
    And a communication event is for a relationship between party 1 and party 2
    And a communication event status is "done"
    And a communication event contact mechanism type is "test"
    And a communication event has a type of "Incoming call"
    And the communication event is in the database
    When I add the purpose of "Interrupt dinner"
    Then the operation was successful
    And the communication event has the purpose "Interrupt dinner"
